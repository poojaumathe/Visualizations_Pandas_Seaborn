# Applied Visualizations with Pandas and Seaborn

Showing Visualizations with python libraries Pandas and seaborn.

• Pandas uses matplotlib and provides some convenient functions for
visualizing data. Lets take a look at the matplotlib's style package.

• Matplotlib comes with a number of predefined styles, which we can
choose from, to change the default look of our plots.Because pandas is using matplotlib under the hood, this will change
the default style of our pandas graphs as well.

• Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib.

• Seaborn is just a wraparound matplotlib.

• It adds styles to make default data visualizations much more visually
appealing and makes creation of specific types of complicated plots
much simpler.
